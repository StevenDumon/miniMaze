Application server
1. Install NginX web server : sudo apt-get install nginx
   Start NginX with sudo service nginx start
   Test that it's working (should see "Welcome to nginx!")
   Stop NginX sudo service nginx stop

2. Configuring NGINX for PHP
   In your nginx site configuration, /etc/nginx/sites-available/default, modify the line in the server {} section (as root) :
  index index.html index.htm to index index.php index.html index.htm
  Uncomment the lines in the server {} section starting with
  listen for ipv4 / ipv6 both
  Scroll down to where it says "location ~ .php {" and uncomment lines so it looks like this:
  location ~ \.php$ {
	  fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
	  fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
	  fastcgi_index index.php;
	  include fastcgi_params;
	}
  
  Reboot or restart services (check of versie php7.2 gebruikt isâ€¦) :
  sudo service php7.2-fpm restart
  sudo service nginx restart
